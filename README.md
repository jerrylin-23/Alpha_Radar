# Alpha Radar

> Formerly *ICT Buy the Dip Analyzer*

A Python-based algorithmic trading tool that detects **ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts** to generate actionable trade plans. Alpha Radar identifies liquidity pools, imbalances, and market structure to find high-probability long entries, and serves them through a live web scanner.

## 📚 ICT Concepts Explained

Understanding *why* this strategy works requires knowledge of how institutional traders and market makers operate.

### 🔴 Equal Highs/Lows (EQH/EQL) — Liquidity Magnets

**What they are:**  
Equal Highs (EQH) and Equal Lows (EQL) are price levels where multiple swing points cluster at nearly the same price. These levels represent **liquidity pools** — concentrations of stop-loss orders.

**Why they matter:**
- **Retail traders place stops above EQH and below EQL** — these are obvious "resistance" and "support" levels.
- **Market makers hunt these stops** — large institutions need liquidity to fill massive orders. They push price into these zones to trigger stop-losses, absorbing retail orders as counterparty liquidity.
- **EQH acts as resistance... until it's raided** — price often sweeps through EQH/EQL before reversing.

**How this tool uses them:**
- Identifies EQL as potential entry zones (price will sweep below before reversal)
- Places stop-loss *slightly below* EQL to avoid getting stopped out during liquidity grabs
- Uses the liquidity sweep as confirmation of reversal

---

### 📊 Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) — Imbalances in Price

**What they are:**  
A Fair Value Gap is a 3-candle pattern where the wicks of candle 1 and candle 3 don't overlap, leaving a "gap" in price. This gap represents an **imbalance** — price moved so aggressively that no trades occurred in that zone.

**Why price reacts at FVGs:**
- **Unfilled orders exist in the gap** — institutions that missed entries will look to fill orders when price returns.
- **Price seeks efficiency** — markets tend to fill imbalances before continuing the trend.
- **FVGs act as magnets** — price is "drawn" back to these zones before making the next major move.

**Bullish vs Bearish FVGs:**
- **Bullish FVG**: Gap created by an up-move → expect price to retrace INTO the gap, find support, and continue higher.
- **Bearish FVG**: Gap created by a down-move → expect price to rally INTO the gap, find resistance, and continue lower.

**How this tool uses them:**
- Identifies nearest bullish FVG below current price as entry zone
- Combines FVG with EQL for confluence (strongest setups)
- Uses FVG midpoint as a refined entry target

### 📈 Power of 3 (PO3) — Market Maker Algorithm

**What it is:**  
The Power of 3 describes a recurring 3-phase market cycle that institutions use to accumulate positions:

1. **Accumulation** — Smart money quietly builds positions. Price consolidates. This is often where EQL/EQH form.

2. **Manipulation** — Price is pushed *against* the intended direction to:
   - Trigger stop-losses (liquidity grab)
   - Create FVGs (imbalances to return to)
   - Trap retail traders on the wrong side

3. **Distribution** — Price explodes in the real direction as institutions distribute their positions to trapped retail traders.

**Why stops are placed below EQL:**
- The **manipulation phase** specifically targets obvious stop-loss zones.
- Placing stops *just below* EQL means you get stopped out during the liquidity raid.
- This tool places stops **further below** to survive the manipulation phase.

### 🎯 The Trading Logic

This analyzer combines these concepts into a systematic approach:

```
1. FIND EQL (Equal Lows)
   └── Identifies where retail stops are clustered

2. FIND BULLISH FVG (below current price)
   └── Identifies imbalance zone where price should react

3. ENTRY = EQL or FVG zone
   └── Enter when price approaches these levels

4. STOP LOSS = Below EQL (with buffer)
   └── Survives the manipulation/liquidity sweep

5. TAKE PROFITS = Based on next EQH/resistance levels
   └── TP1: Conservative (nearest resistance)
   └── TP2: Moderate (prior swing high)
   └── TP3: Aggressive (next major EQH)
```

```
Open **http://127.0.0.1:5001** in your browser.

### 4. Run Backtest
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python src/run_backtest.py NVDA   # or AAPL, GOOGL, SPY, etc.
```
Results saved to `src/samples/<symbol>_daily_<date>/`

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Watchlist
Edit `src/tickers.txt` to customize the scanner watchlist:
```
AAPL
NVDA
TSLA
# Add your tickers here
```

### Environment Variables
| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DEMO_MODE` | `false` | Set to `true` for limited scanning (20 tickers, 15-min intervals) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | _(unset)_ | PostgreSQL connection string. If set, scan results persist to Postgres; otherwise the app falls back to an in-memory cache automatically. |

### Scanner Sensitivity
In `src/app.py`, adjust the `near_entry` threshold (default: 1.5%):
```python
'near_entry': bool(0 <= dist_pct <= 0.015)
```
